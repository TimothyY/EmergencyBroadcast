     * <h4>{@link android.hardware.Sensor#TYPE_GYROSCOPE Sensor.TYPE_GYROSCOPE}:
     * </h4> All values are in radians/second and measure the rate of rotation
     * around the device's local X, Y and Z axis. The coordinate system is the
     * same as is used for the acceleration sensor. Rotation is positive in the
     * counter-clockwise direction. That is, an observer looking from some
     * positive location on the x, y or z axis at a device positioned on the
     * origin would report positive rotation if the device appeared to be
     * rotating counter clockwise. Note that this is the standard mathematical
     * definition of positive rotation and does not agree with the definition of
     * roll given earlier.
     * <ul>
     * <li> values[0]: Angular speed around the x-axis </li>
     * <li> values[1]: Angular speed around the y-axis </li>
     * <li> values[2]: Angular speed around the z-axis </li>
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * Typically the output of the gyroscope is integrated over time to
     * calculate a rotation describing the change of angles over the timestep,
     * for example:
