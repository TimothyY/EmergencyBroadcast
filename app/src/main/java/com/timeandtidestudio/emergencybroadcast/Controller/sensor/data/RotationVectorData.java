     *  <p>The rotation vector represents the orientation of the device as a combination of an <i>angle</i>
     *  and an <i>axis</i>, in which the device has rotated through an angle &#952 around an axis
     *  &lt;x, y, z>.</p>
     *  <p>The three elements of the rotation vector are
     *  &lt;x*sin(&#952/2), y*sin(&#952/2), z*sin(&#952/2)>, such that the magnitude of the rotation
     *  vector is equal to sin(&#952/2), and the direction of the rotation vector is equal to the
     *  direction of the axis of rotation.</p>
     *  </p>The three elements of the rotation vector are equal to
     *  the last three components of a <b>unit</b> quaternion
     *  &lt;cos(&#952/2), x*sin(&#952/2), y*sin(&#952/2), z*sin(&#952/2)>.</p>
     *  <p>Elements of the rotation vector are unitless.
     *  The x,y, and z axis are defined in the same way as the acceleration
     *  sensor.</p>
     *  The reference coordinate system is defined as a direct orthonormal basis,
     *  where:
     * </p>
     *
     * <ul>
     * <li>X is defined as the vector product <b>Y.Z</b> (It is tangential to
     * the ground at the device's current location and roughly points East).</li>
     * <li>Y is tangential to the ground at the device's current location and
     * points towards magnetic north.</li>
     * <li>Z points towards the sky and is perpendicular to the ground.</li>
     * </ul>
